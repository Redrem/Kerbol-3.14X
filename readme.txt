Optimal konfig KSP

Set of files of configurations for creation of difficult, but conveniently in use System of Kerbol. Now Stock not too chiterny for flights as in vanilla game, but also not too weak as in RSS.

So far it is created only a config on RSS of fashions, and basic solar system. All deltas are increased by 1,772 times. The sizes by 3,14 times. 

We will pobirat further the best of other spendthrifts. Can modernize a little. 3.14 - symbol of an ideal figure, circle. Now and our symbol.

Pleasant game.

Details

In a basis the configuration is taken RSS 6.4X 
The linear sizes of Planets, orbits - 3,14X 
Acceleration of gravity-1X 
The upper bound of the atmosphere it is taken with 6,4X = 30-32% (1,3X) 
Relief coefficient from there = 1,5X 
Orbital speeds and the periods of rotation - a root 3,14 = 1,772X 
Time of day: Kerbin 12 hours; Jule, Eve, Eloo, Dres - a drain; Gillie-/3,14 = 0,318 - to show force of centrifugal rotation; 
The Others = 1,772. Dyuna-ayk, Muna, and all companions of Jule are synchronized as well as in a drain from the accounting of increase in time of rotation on an orbit. 
Atmosphere density on Eve, Jule = 1,772 X, On the Dune - / 1,772X, On Leith 1/3,14X. Kerbin-1 atmosphere.

Delta of going into orbit of Kerbin 6,8 km/s
